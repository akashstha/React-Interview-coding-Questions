/* Question: Build a Searchable User List
Prompt:

You are given a list of users. Build a simple React component that allows a user to:

See the list of users.

Type into a search box to filter the list in real-time.

Example Input:

js
Copy
Edit
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Akash' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Sita' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Ram' },
  { id: 4, name: 'Hari' }
];
Expected UI:

An <input /> field to type the search term.

A <ul> that shows the filtered names.

Bonus Requirements (for senior-level):
Debounce the search input (e.g., delay filtering until 300ms after the user stops typing).

Show “No results found” if there’s no match.

Write clean, reusable components.
